In our every day life as a businessman  goes through the constant dilemma of setting a budget such that he gets a potential set of customers . Each customer has a budget he will your appliance at your declared price if and only if the price is less than or equal to the customerâ€™s budget . You want to fix a price such that the revenue earned is maximized . We can use a simple C program to formulate a simple business plan .It will use basic sort functions , we will provide variable for different cases .Suppose we have four potential customers and their budgets are 20,30,53,14. In this case the maximum revenue they get is 60 .

Here is a C  program depicting the following::
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int n,i,k,j; 
    printf("enter theno of people you want to consider in the  budget\n ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    long long int a[n];
    printf("enter the values of budget of the customer::\n");
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%lld",&a[i]);
        printf("%lld\n",a[i]);
    }
   for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<n-i-1;j++)
        {   int t;
            if(a[j]>a[j+1])
                {    t=a[j];
                    a[j]=a[j+1];
                     a[j+1]=t;
                }
        }
    }
    for(k=0;k<n;k++)
    {
        a[k]=a[k]*(n-k);
    }
     for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<n-i-1;j++)
        {   int t;
            if(a[j]>a[j+1])
                {    t=a[j];
                    a[j]=a[j+1];
                     a[j+1]=t;
                }
        }
    }
        printf("the maximum revenue is ::%lld \n",a[n-1]);
       
    return 0;
}
